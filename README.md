# FindStuff

##Description
When you want to find something, tweet with #askFindStuff. My bot will reply with nearby stores that have what you are looking for.

###Tools
For this project I used IBM Watson's AlchemyLanguage to extract keywords from tweet.
I also used the Yellow Page's API to find nearby businesses.
Built in node.js with Twit library.

###Usage
npm start

####Notes
A build from from my earlier project findmecool.tech
Currently set to a default location.
